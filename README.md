# split-comparator
A comparison tool for .lss files from LiveSplit

Functions:
  - Count how many times each segment has been reset on.
  - Compare each segment from two runs in the same file.
  - Create a hybrid run from the better segments of two runs.
  - Create a list of all your runs in order from fastest to slowest, and show their IDs.

If you've skipped a segment in a run, the comparison tool will also skip the segment in its comparisons
